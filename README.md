# About My Professor – Chrome Extension

This Chrome Extension enhances the UCSC course enrollment site by injecting **professor information cards** under each course panel.  
It fetches professor data from UCSC’s public directory API using each professor’s UID.

---

## Features

- Detects course panels on UCSC enrollment pages.
- Extracts abbreviated professor names and maps them to UIDs.
- Calls UCSC’s public API to fetch professor information.
- Injects a React component (info card) directly under each professor’s name.
- Caches API results locally to reduce repeated requests.()

- **React + Webpack** – UI framework and bundler
- **Content Scripts** – scan and inject React roots
- **Background Service Worker** – API fetch + caching
- **CSS** – styling
- **chrome.storage.local** – cache layer

## Notes

1. When commiting to the remote repo, **make sure to run** `npm run clean` to make sure your code is formatted accurately. This is done so everyone follows the same formatting style. If not, you'll fail the formatting check :(
